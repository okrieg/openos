    "To paraphrase [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) programs expand to fill the memory available to hold them, and home computers have millions times more memory than they had when Larry was young.  As discussed in the introduction memory is fast but small and expensive compared to storage, but it is volatile, all changes are lost after a reboot.  Memory management is the part of the operating system that allocates, frees and tracks the usage of memory.  It manages the virtual memory of each process, and all the physical memory of the system; making it available to different processes through virtual memory depending on their demand. \n",
