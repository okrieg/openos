    "# What you should know\n",
    "\n",
    "From having taught operating systems for multiple years, we have learned two things: you have learned this material in other courses, and you probably got away without really mastering it. For example, many of you have never really written a proper makefile to automate compilation, and most of you have debugged programs without mastering the debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before taking this course, you should have good familiarity with:\n",
    "1. [Unix shells](cont:gs:tools:shell)\n",
    "    * In this section we will introduce several shell commands that you will see and use very frequently. We encourage you to experiment with all of the commands and examples covered in this section! It is by far the best way to become comfortable with the shell.\n",
    "2. [editors](cont:gs:tools:editors)\n",
    "    * In this section we will introduce two terminal text editors that are frequently used on Unix machines. Learning to write code on these editors are essential without access to modern IDEs with GUIs like Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "3. [compiling](cont:gs:tools:make)\n",
    "    * As the size of your projects increase, the need for automation via Makefiles also increase. You don't want to be typing the compile commands for all of your files or repeatidly pressing the up arrow for previous compile commands after every change.\n",
    "4. [git](cont:gs:tools:git)\n",
    "    * Version control is important to keep records of long-standing projects and to clearly communicate changes to other developers working on the same project.\n",
    "5. [GDB debugger](cont:gs:tools:gdb)\n",
    "    * Print statements won't show everything going on in a process. In addition to printing variable values, GDB allows more powerful debugging tools such as changing the value of variables at run time, switching between threads, examining CPU registers, etc.\n",
    "6. [C programming language](cont:gs:tools:c)\n",
    "    * It is the most used programming language for operating systems. By mastering the language, you will reduce the number of syntax errors, and can focus more on debugging the logical errors.\n",
    "7. [unit tests](cont:gs:tools:testing)\n",
    "    * They are not only used to determine whether or not a program runs correctly, but also to test whether or not you understand how the system is supposed to work. They are really helpful for edge cases. Get rid of the \"guess and check\" mindset and write some tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can guarantee that you won't be successful if you do not master your tools because the programming assignments for operating system courses tend to me more demanding. We recommend [this book](https://jappavoo.github.io/UndertheCovers/textbook/unix/intro.html#operating-systems-and-unix) by Jonathan Appavoo as a more detailed reference on most of what we cover here."

    "## Shell\n",
    "The shell is a basic interface that allows users to communicate with the kernel and any installed programs. Whenever you open a terminal, the kernel starts an instance of a shell program, or shell \"session\". When most people interact with computers, they do so through graphical user interfaces that they navigate using a mouse or their finger. The shell is completely text-based and designed for programmers. It has its own programming language of special commands to access kernel functionalities. For more information about terminals and shells, please refer to the relevant sections of [the following textbook](https://jappavoo.github.io/UndertheCovers/textbook/unix/intro.html#operating-systems-and-unix).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some basic shell commands\n",
    "#### Help and information\n",
    "##### `man <command>`\n",
    "This is probably the most important command for students new to Linux and interacting with computers via the shell. The `man` command (short for \"manual\") allows you to access documentation about all programs installed on a system. For example, to view documentation for the `man` command itself, you simply type `man man` to open its man page. You can scroll through man pages using the arrow keys or `ctrl+f` (move forward one page) and `ctrl+b` (move backward one page) and exit back to the command line by typing `q`. For more information about any of the other commands discussed in this chapter (or any chapter for that matter), consult these **man pages**!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `apropos <keyword>`\n",
    "This is probably the second most important command for students new to Linux and interacting with computers via the shell. If you type `man apropos`, its description is\n",
    "> apropos searches a set of database files containing short descriptions of system commands for keywords and displays the result on the standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it searches all `man-able` programs for the `keyword`, and displays it on the screen. This can be useful if you know that a program description has a certain keyword or functionality, but not know the specific name of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Navigating your system via the command line \n",
    "The shell provides us with a way to navigate through our machine's file directory. When you open a new terminal in the development environment, you will be in your **home directory**. The directory that you are in at any given time is called the **working directory**. To see what your current working directory is, simply type `pwd` into the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ pwd \n",
    "/home/username \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to reference files and directories in the shell. The first is using **absolute paths**. When referring to directories this way, you have to write the entire path to the desired directory starting at the root `/`. The advantage to this approach is that these references remain static no matter where you are in the system. As long as you don't move a file, it's absolute path remains the same. To change your working directory, you can use the `cd` command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cd /home\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command does not print anything to the command line, but if you rerun `pwd` you will see that the working directory has changed!\n",
    "\n",
    "The other option for referencing files is to use **relative paths**. They are called relative paths because they are written *relative* to your current working directory. Thus, the path to the file of interest depends on your working directory. The advantage to using relative paths is that they are generally much shorter than absolute paths. In addition, there are some nice shortcuts you can use if you aren't trying to move too far away from your current working directory. For example, if I want to move to the parent directory of my working directory, I can simply type `cd ..` instead of writing out the whole path of the parent directory. When moving into the child directory of the current working directory, you can just type `cd child` or `cd child/grandchild` and the shell will know that you are using a relative path since it does not start with a `/`. Typing `cd child` is equivalent to typing `cd ./child`, since `.` is used to denote the current working directory. You can also get to the \"grandparent\" directory by typing `cd ../..` or one of your parent directory's other children using the command `cd ../sibling`. To go to your home directory, you can type `cd ~`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to view the contents of a directory. You can do this using the `ls` command. If you provide it with no arguments, it will simply print the contents of your working directory. \n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "file1.txt file2.txt hw1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The directories will be differentiated from the plain files in the development environment with bold colored text. You can also provide an absolute or relative path as an argument to the `ls` command (e.g., `ls /path/to/directory/`) to see the contents of a different directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Recap:\n",
    "* All file paths start at the root directory `/` and you can reference them absolutely or using relative paths\n",
    "* Your home directory is `~`, the current working directory is `.`, and the parent of the working directory is `..`\n",
    "* `pwd`: prints your working directory\n",
    "* `cd /some/directory`: move to the specified directory\n",
    "* `ls /some/directory`: print the files and directories within the chosen directory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating, viewing, and manipulating files and directories\n",
    "* `touch <desiredfilename>`: create a new file. \n",
    "* `cat <filename>`: print contents of a file to the terminal.\n",
    "* `mv /path/to/<filename> /desired/path/to/file/`: move a file to a different directory. To move a directory instead of just a single file, use the flag `-r`. \n",
    "* `cp <filename> <filecopyname>`: make a copy of an existing file. \n",
    "* `mdkir <desireddirectoryname>`: create a new directory. \n",
    "* `emacs <filename>`: open the file \"filename\" in the EMACS editor. More on this in the following section.\n",
    "* `wc <filename>`: print newline, word, and byte counts for a file. To see just the word count, add the flag `-w`.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Miscellaneous\n",
    "##### `echo`\n",
    "Display a line of text to standard out. \n",
    "```\n",
    "$ echo \"Hello world\"\n",
    "Hello world\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### `ctrl+c`\n",
    "This will terminate whatever process/command is currently running in the shell. Great if you think your code may be stuck in an infinite loop or is just taking much longer than you thought it would to finish running. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### `ctrl+l`\n",
    "This will clear your terminal and move the prompt up to the top of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symbols\n",
    "##### |\n",
    "This is known as the \"pipe\" symbol and is used to redirect the output of one command into the input of a second command. For example, if I type `ls .. | wc -w`, the total number of files/directories in the `..` directory will be printed to the command line. \n",
    "##### >\n",
    "This symbol is used to assign a redirect-out to a command. For example, if I type: `echo \"Hello world\" > hw.txt`, instead of printing \"Hello world\" to the terminal, the right carrot symbol would direct that output into the file \"hw.txt\". \n",
    "##### <\n",
    "This symbol is used to assign a redirect-in to a command. For example, we can type `cat < file.txt`. In this situation, this is equivalent to `cat file.txt`. \n",
    "##### &\n",
    "Typing the ampersand symbol & at the end of a command will result in that command being run in the background. This means that you will immediately see another prompt even if the command you run has not finished running. "

[VIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) and [EMACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) are most common. **We are requiring that students use EMACS for this course, and those who use VIM will be penalized.**\n",

    "EMACS is a slightly more familiar-looking text editor that is valued for its extensibility. It is extremely configurable with a lot of tools and packages available. \n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file in EMACS, type `emacs <filename>`. Unlike in VIM, you will immediately be able to write in/edit thew file. Once you are finished editing, you type `ctrl+x` followed by `ctrl+c` to save and exit. It will prompt you to confirm that you want to save and quit. Typing `y` and then enter will return you to the terminal.\n",

    "\n",
    "```gcc filename.c -o filename```\n",

In these more complex situations, we can use `make`. Make automates running commands on files when they have changed and is commonly used in \"building\" programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use `make`, you must write a file called a `makefile` that describes the relationships between the files in your program and provides commands for updating each file. Usually for c programs, the executable file is updated from object files (`.o` files), which are in turn made by compiling source files (`.c` files). Once you have written your makefile, you can just run the shell command `make` and it will perform all necessary recompilations. `make` knows which files need to be updated based on the last-modification times of the files. You can also provide command line arguments to make to specify which files should be recompiled and how. \n",

    "    ...\n",
    "    ...\n",

    "\n",
    "The *prerequisite* is a file that is used as input to create the target. It will often be multiple files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *recipe* is an action that `make` carries out. A recipe may have more than one command. There must be a tab character at the beginning of each recipe line.\n",

    "In the first line, we specify the flags we want to use to compile C files by assigning a value to CFLAGS (more on implicit variables like CFLAGS [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html)). The `override` directive just makes sure you use the assignments in the makefile even if the variable has previously been set with a command argument. \n",

    "* `-g`: adds debugging symbols to executable\n",
    "* `$(CFLAGS)`: include default flags\n",
    "* `-I.`: specifies directory where header files can be found (in this example, the working directory `.`\n",

    "\n",
    "Below that, there is an additional line that you can edit to add additional test scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the rules in the makefile have phony targets. They are not names for files, rather just names for a recipe to be executed when an explicit request is made. Using a phony target helps avoid conflicts with files of the same name and improves performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *checkprogs* rule builds all of the test programs. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "In order to use gdb, you will have to use the `-g` command line flag when compiling. This flag makes sure that the necessary debugging information is produced. \n",
    "```\n",
    "gcc -g -o main main.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will compile the program `main.c` into an executable named \"main\" with debugging information. \n",
    "\n",
    "To open the program in the debugger, you can type `gdb main`. To exit gdb, type `q` or `quit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gdb provides documentation, which you can access by typing the command `help`. This will provide a list of topics, and you can then get information about a specific topic or command by typing `help <topic>` or `help <command>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using gdb to debug\n",
    "One of the more useful things you can do in gdb is set **breakpoints** and observe the state of the process mid-execution. There are a couple of ways to set a breakpoint:\n",
    "* `break <function>`: sets a breakpoint at the beginning of `function`.\n",
    "* `break <linenumber>`: sets the breakpoint to the given line number in the source file. Execution will stop **before** that line has been executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code is in multiple files, you may have to specify a file name before the function name or line number, e.g. `break <filename>:<function>` or `break <filename>:<linenumber>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To delete the breakpoints you have set, you can type `delete`. You can also delete a specific breakpoint by typing `delete <number>`. To find out what number each breakpoint is, type `info breakpoints`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have set all your desired breakpoints, you need to run the program. To do this, simply type the command `run` into gdb. If the program takes command line arguments, you can provide them the same way as you would in the command line, except you say \"run\" instead of the program name. Your code will execute up to where you specified your first breakpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you reach your breakpoint, you will probably want to look at the contents of the stack or some variables to make sure that your program is executing as expected. To see the current value of a variable, you can simply type `print <variablename>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To continue running the program after stopping at a break time, you have several options. Typing `continue` will set the program running again until you hit another breakpoint or the process finishes. Typing `step` (or just `s`) will execute the current source line and stop execution before the next source line, If the line that is about to be executed is a function call, then `step` will step into that function. In contrast, moving through execution using the `next` will not \"step in\" to a called function. It will continue until the next source line in *the current function*. \n",

    "#### Debugging threads\n",
    "Once you learn about pthreads, a very powerful thing you can do is switch between threads and step through in the order you choose. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `info threads`: lists all existing threads.\n",
    "* `thread <thread_id>`: selects which thread to switch to.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have selected which thread you would like to step through, you can use the basic stepping commands to execute the next instructions. Note that already existing break points exist across all threads. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging signals\n",
    "Once you learn about signals, you can use gdb to change its behavior on how to handle those signals. \n",
    "* `info signals` or `info signals <signal>`: lists all signals (or one signal) and shows how gdb responds to it.\n",

    "\n",
    "The C programming language is a high level statically typed procedural compiled programming language valued for its accessibility to low level computer memory. You have probably already learned the language in a previous course, but this course will utilize some of its advanced features that have probably not been taught in those introductory courses. To make the learning process easier, we recommend reviewing its syntax and concepts. Here are a few:\n",

[This website](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html) contains the preferred coding style for the Linux kernel. Although not required, adhering to a style will increase productivity so you and whoever else looks at your code will spend less time trying to understand what you wrote."

    "\n",
    "Unit tests are a way to check if your program runs as expected. Combine unit tests with makefiles, then you can automate both the `compiling` **and** `testing` phase of development. We call these tests **unit tests** because they are supposed to test a singular functionality of a component in a system rather than the whole system. You will spend less time debugging unit tests than testing the entire system because you can determine that the problem is with the specific functionality that it is testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating your own tests are **`essential`** to completing the programming assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we have 3 functions: `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`. `foo` is a helper function to `bar` and `baz`, and `bar` is a helper function to `baz`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "int foo()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "int bar()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    return foo();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "int baz()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    return bar() * foo()\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "int main()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    assert(foo() > 0);  // this is a first level unit test\n",
    "    assert(bar() > 0);  // this is a second level unit test\n",
    "    assert(baz() > 0);  // this is a final level unit test aka system test\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be very easy to create a test for `baz` and check the expected outputs, however, there is a possibility that the test passes for the wrong reasons (two wrongs might make a right). In the case that testing `baz` fails, it would be much harder to debug `baz` without first testing if both `foo` and `bar` pass their tests. Although this is a simple example, this idea of creating unit tests from the first level to the last will greatly improve development effeciency, and will train you to think about a complex system in bite sized chunks."
