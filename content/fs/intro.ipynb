    "The power of Unix comes from the fundamental idea that [everything is a file](cont:gs:abstractions:file) or really more accurately a stream.  However, in many cases we want to store data persistently on disks and in that case file systems provide that abstraction, and, as we will see, a richer set of abstractions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We first describe this [rich interface](cont:fs:interface) Unix (and many similar systems) require of file systems.  We then discuss the [ugly hardware](cont:fs:disks) abstractions that needs to be transformed by file systems into this interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "After describing how you get to the file system [on disk](cont:fs:layout), the next four chapters describe key file system design issues, namely how to: 1)[keep track of the blocks used in a file](fs:dl_track_used), 2)[keep track of the free blocks](fs:dl_track_free), 3) [maintain the name space](fs:dl_name), and 4) [deal with failures](fs:dl_failures).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final two chapters [provide examples of real file systems](fs:dl_ex_exx) and [discuss what runs in the kernel, and the VFS layer unix file systems have](cont:fs:kernel).\n",
